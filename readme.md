# ViewModel Customizer


A minimalist Open Source Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.4+ that gives you complete control over your first-person viewmodel.

I'll make a mod for other versions too (prob)!

New v2 GUI and CFG system already here 😱

## ✨ Features

### 🎮 Full Customization
- **Position** - Move your viewmodel on X, Y, and Z axes
- **Rotation** - Adjust Yaw, Pitch, and Roll independently
- **Scale** - Resize your held items from tiny to massive

### 🎯 Animation Control
- **No Swing** - Prevents your item from visually swinging (keeps rotation animations)
- **Scale Swing** - Scale swing animations with your custom size
- **No Equip Animation** - Removing by default the pulling-out animation when switching items

### ⚙️ Profile system
- The mod keeps multiple named profiles stored as JSON files in `config/viewmodel/configs/` with the active profile tracked in `config/viewmodel/active.txt`.
- Every change made in the UI auto-saves to the active profile, preserving your adjustments without extra clicks.
- Create new profiles, rename them, or delete unused ones directly from the config card.
- Use the dropdown in the left config card to pick any saved profile instantly.

### 🎨 Clean UI
- Minimalist black & white design
- Per-setting reset buttons (⟲)
- Reset all button for convenience
- Real-time preview while adjusting

## 🎮 Usage

- Press `V` to open the ViewModel editor (configurable in keybinds)
- Adjust sliders to customize your viewmodel
- Click ⟲ to reset individual settings
- Click "Reset All" to restore defaults
- Settings save automatically in real-time
